# ðŸ“˜ Running Jupyter Notebooks in Sagemaker Studio

Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive Python environment. Cells in a Jupyter notebook are a modular unit of code or text that you can execute and view outputs for.

To run a cell, highlight it and click the Run icon in the toolbar at the top.

When a cell is running, you will see a * in the square brackets ([ ]) against the cell.

When a cell is finished running successfully, you will see a number appear in the [ ] with no error traceback after the cell.

If an error occurred while running a cell, you will see an error traceback after the cell.

To fix errors, you may need to update previous cells. If you do, re-run all the cells following the one(s) you updated.

To interrupt a running cell, click the Stop icon in the toolbar at the top.

The UI might differ slightly if you are running Jupyter Notebooks outside of Sagemaker Studio. Refer to the appropriate documentation if running the notebook using a different service.
