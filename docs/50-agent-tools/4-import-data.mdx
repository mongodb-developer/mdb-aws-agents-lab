# üëê Import data

The MongoDB learning assistant has two tools- a vector search tool to retrieve information to answer questions about MongoDB, and another tool to get the content of articles in our Developer Center for summarization.

Let's import the data required by these tools into two MongoDB collections. This is as simple as making a `GET` request to a serverless AWS Lambda function that we have created for you.

Run the cells under the **Step 3: Import data** section in the notebook to import the data required by our agent's tools, into MongoDB collections.

To verify that the data has been imported into your MongoDB cluster, navigate to the **Overview** page in the Atlas UI. In the **Clusters section**, select your cluster and click **Browse collections**.

Ensure that you see a database called _mongodb_agents_lab_, and two collections namely _chunked_articles_ and _full_articles_ under it. Note the number and format of documents in both the collections.
