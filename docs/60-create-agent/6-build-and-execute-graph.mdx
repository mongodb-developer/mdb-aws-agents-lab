# üëê Build and execute the graph

Now that we have defined the nodes and edges of the graph, let's put the graph together and execute it to ensure that our agent is working as expected. 

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 10: Build the graph** and **Step 11: Execute the graph** sections in the notebook to build and execute the graph.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_17**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
graph.add_node("agent", agent)
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_18**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
graph.add_node("tools", tool_node)
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_19**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
graph.add_edge(START, "agent")
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_20**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
graph.add_edge("tools", "agent")
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_21**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    route_tools,
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
```
</div>
</details>

:::caution
Upon executing the graph, if you see the agent get stuck in an infinite tool-calling loop, play around with the prompt in Step 7 and run the cells that follow until you initialize the `llm_with_tools` variable. If this doesn't work, consider this a lesson in working with non-deterministic ML models. üôÇ
